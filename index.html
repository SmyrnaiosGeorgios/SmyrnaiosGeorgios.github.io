    <p>My name is George and I am 26 years old. Some of the things I enjoy are movies, music, cooking and video games.
        Some of my favorite movies would be "What we do in the shadows", "Koe no Katachi" and "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children".
         I enjoy many types of music but I mostly listen to
        Japanese metal bands such as "The Gazette" or "Kizu". As for video games I primarily play RPGs and some of my
        favorite franchises include "Persona", "Nier" and "Monster Hunter".
